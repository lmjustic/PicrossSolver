Created by [Luke Justice](https://github.com/lmjustic)
### Description
This program will solve Picture Cross puzzles (How to Play: [https://youtu.be/d-I5Ng2oYyM](https://youtu.be/d-I5Ng2oYyM)).
This is accomplished by using a backtracking algorithm to brute force a solution.
The goal of this project was to practice with the backtracking algorithm.
### Usage
- Create an input file following the format noted in InputFileFormat.txt
- It is recommended to use the Makefile to compile the program
- Once compiled the program may be run from the command line using the following command
> solve -i "inputfile.txt" -o "outputfile.txt"
- View the solution in your output file
